# Does The RAS Metric System Predict Success In The NFL?
In 2013, Kent Lee Platte, a self proclaimed Maths junkie created a model to convert a group of metrics into a scoring system for prospective NFL players. This would come to be known as [RAS](https://ras.football/) or Relative Athetic Score.
Kent tells the story of how he came up with the system which provides a lot of context [here](https://www.prideofdetroit.com/2016/5/16/11678686/relative-athletic-scores-what-they-are-and-why-they-work).

If nothing else, I hope that you can at least take away from this how a non NFL affiliated individual, driven by his passion for data and football created a model that made NFL scouting a lot easier and whether he knows it or not, changed the landscape for "pre draft" analysts for years to come.

## Executive Summary
This project objective is not to challenge the RAS model, it is to use the score as a coefficiant to both understand the correlation between a score and success. Additionally we will use that to calculate the probability that a high score will lead to a successful career using the basis of this hypothesis:

*H0* - **A RAS of *x* will lead to a successful NFL career**

*H1* - **RAS doesnt not affect the career success of an NFL Player**

It is to be noted Kent has never stipulated a high score will lead to a successful career. The NFL has a lot of variables so isolating them to minimise the impact on the model(s) will be paramount.
